Project:
Potential Revenue Loss and Gain Prediction for Hotel Reservations

Introduction:
One of the major reasons for potential revenue loss in the hotel industry is booking cancellations. However, not all cancellations lead to potential revenue loss, as some of the reservations are non refundable or are canceled way ahead of arrival date.
The goal of this project was to analyze a hotel booking dataset and train predictive classification
models that could accurately predict whether a future reservation would lead to a potential revenue
gain or loss. Such models can assist hoteliers in revenue management.

Dataset:
This dataset has 119390 rows and 32 columns. The columns include various aspects of hotel reservations.
